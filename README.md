# Bug Busters Community Website

## About Bug Busters

**Bug Busters** is an **open-source community** run by students for the students. Our aim is that no student should be left unknown about the opportunities going on let it be open source events, hackathons, internships, etc. We believe that every student must learn some skills and showcase them in their resume. Through this community, we want to reach every student and help them in enriching their careers.

This repo contains the code used to create our website. Please visit [here](https://github.com/BugBustersCommunity) to check out our other open-source repos.
